/// Before the fix, if a ticket was deleted from disk and `scan --reindex` was
/// run, the deleted ticket's entry would survive the Tantivy index and still
/// appear in search results.  After the fix, `clear_all()` is called at the
/// start of every `--reindex` pass, so stale entries are removed.
